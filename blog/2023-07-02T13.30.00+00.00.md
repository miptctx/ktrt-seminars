### Abstract

It has been proven that a finite four-valent graph with a cross structure at the vertices cannot be embedded in a plane while preserving this structure if and only if there are two cycles with pairwise distinct edges in it, having exactly one transversal point (in terms of the cross structure). This gives a quadratic (in the number of vertices) algorithm for recognizing the planarity of a graph with such a structure."On the Vassiliev conjecture on planarity of framed 4-valent graphs
