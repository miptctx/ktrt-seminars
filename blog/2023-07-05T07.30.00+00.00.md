### Abstract

We develop a theory of covering digraphs, similar to the theory of covering spaces. By applying this theory to Cayley digraphs, we build a "bridge" between GLMY-theory and group homology theory, which helps to reduce path homology calculations to group homology computations. We show some cases where this approach allows us to fully express path homology in terms of group homology. To illustrate this method, we provide a path homology computation for the Cayley digraph of the additive group of rational numbers with a generating set consisting of inverses to factorials.
