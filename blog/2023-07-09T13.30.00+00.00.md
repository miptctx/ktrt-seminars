### Abstract

Our work is to obtain self-wedging arraysfrom identical blocks. Based on the definition of wedging in one layer,a method was invented that jammed the block in specific planes, thanksto which designs were obtained in which the block is wedged in 3, 5 and 6 planes.Then a simple numerical method was written to determine the wedgedness in the layer,and then a function that gives some coefficient of the wedging, based onher. At the moment, a method is being added that produces the evolution of the block according to this function, for finding the optimal given function. As a result, the research was reduced to the assessment the factor of safety of a given structure, which is based on a specific subtask.
