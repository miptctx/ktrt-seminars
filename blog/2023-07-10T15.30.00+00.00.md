### Abstract

The canonical action of the compact torus T^n on the complex Grassmannmanifolds $G_{n,2}$ of two-dimensionalcomplex subspaces in the complex vector space $C^{n}$ is an importantexample which has applications in manyareas of mathematics.
In studying the corresponding orbit spaces in our papers in the last fewyears, we introduced and studied the objects, such as chambersof a hypersimplex, spaces of parameters of chambers, universal space ofparameters, which turn out to be of crucial importance for theirdescription.

We present our recent results which establish relations between some ofthese objects and moduli spaces of weighted stable rational curves ofgenus zero.

The talk is based on joint works with Victor M. Buchstaber.
