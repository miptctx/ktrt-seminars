### Abstract

This talk is an introduction to knot theory in terms of graphs and knot and link diagrams. We will concentrate on how the Reidemeister moves (a model for the topological motions of knots) work and how to obtain invariants of knots by “coloring” the diagrams. The talk will be self-contained and we will discuss unsolved problems at this level.
