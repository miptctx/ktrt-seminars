### Abstract

In this talk we show why the calculation for bigraded 2-color homology of a CW complex of a surface is not the same as Khovanov homology for virtual links, even through the functor that transforms the underlying ribbon graph of the CW complex to a virtual link. Thus, bigraded n-color homology is a different homology theory from Khovanov homology.
This talk will be general in nature and include some recent history behind the problem of coloring faces (edges) of planar and ribbon graphs.
