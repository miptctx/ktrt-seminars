### Abstract

We recall basic definitions from Knot Theory, Braid Theory andthe construction of J. Wu and F. Cohen which connects braid groups andhomotopy groups of 2-sphere. In more detail we discuss singular braidgroups and its subgroup of pure singular braid group. We describepresentation of these groups and linear representation.
