## Knots, graphs and groups

### Abstract

In this talk, we define a ​"​space of virtual knots" that is analogous to the space $\mathbb{K}$ of knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is done be first translating the notion of​"knot", ​"isotopy", and ​"knot invariant" into the 2-category of Grothendieck topoi. For example, a​"knot" becomes a geometric morphism from the category of sets to the category of sheaves on the space $\mathbb{K}$. In other words, a​"knot" is a point of the Grothendieck topos $\text{Sh}(\mathbb{K})$. This parallels the fact that a knot is a point of the knot space. We then show that there is a site $(\textbf{VK},J_{\textbf{VK}})$ such that the category of sheaves $\text{Sh}(\textbf{VK})$ on this site behaves naturally as a ​"space of virtual knots". For example, the points of this topos are exactly virtual knots. Likewise, we recover virtual isotopy and virtual knot invariants as geometric morphisms. This talk is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10318.
