### Abstract

We present a couple of complete invariants S and R of oriented knots inspace. The value of each invariant on any knot k is a set, infinite forthe first and finite for the second. The value R(k) (a finite set) iscomputed algorithmically from any knot diagram K of k in a finite numberof steps. The algorithm reveals the knotting number of k as well.
