### Abstract

The regular hexagon has two tilings into three rhombi; they differ by a flip. This forms an illusion of a "reversible cube". A tiling picture of a (2n)-gon into rhombille can be viewed in 3D as a collection of cubes in 3-space.
The flip naturally corresponds to addition/deletion of a cube lying on the top.

The dual picture to such a rhombille tiling is a 4-valent graph on the plane which can be seen as a tangle diagram.

The hexagonal flip corresponds to the third Reidemeister move.

We have mentioned that such flips naturally correspond to generators of the group $G_{n}^{3}$.

Besides, from the point of view of configurations of lines, the hexagonal flip can be viewed as a Desargues flip, and the main relation of the group $G_{n}^{3}$ of length 8 naturally appears in the picture.

In the talk we shall relate various problems in geometry, topology, and group theory, among which we mention hyperbolic volumes, configurations of lines, braid group actions.

Many unsolved problems will be formulated.
