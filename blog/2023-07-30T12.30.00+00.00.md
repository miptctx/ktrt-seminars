### Abstract

The 4-Color Theorem is simple to state but hard to prove: Can a map of states of any country be painted with only four colors so that no two neighboring states are painted the same color? In this talk, we explore the unusual and unexpected connections between the 4-Color Theorem of graphs and physicists' intuition throughout history. This will lead us to a discussion of string theory, which is one of the leading "theories of everything" in physics. String theory is a modern day attempt to realize Einstein's dream of merging quantum theory with general relativity. In the second half of the talk, we will describe how graphs naturally lead to strings propagating over time, and how the $4$-Color Theorem appears to play a role in Einstein's dream.
At the end, if time, I will give some thoughts on what mathematics you should work on during your undergraduate and graduate school to work in this area of mathematical physics.

This talk is set at an undergraduate level. It will mostly contain history and discussion about key physicists and mathematicians, elude to their motivations, and give a big picture sense of the mathematics behind string theory without getting into the really hard stuff.
