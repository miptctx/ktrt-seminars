### Abstract

Ptolemy coordinates is an efficient tool to parameterize (a certain type of) SL(2,C)-representations of ideally triangulated 2- or 3-manifolds. Inspired from works of super-Ptolemy coordinates for surfaces, we introduce super-Ptolemy coordinates for ideally triangulated 3-manifolds which parameterize OSp(2|1)-representations. Analogous to the 1-loop conjecture, we then propose a conjectural formula to compute $C^2$-torsion polynomials, also known as twisted Alexander polynomials associated with SL(2,C)-representations. This is joint work with Stavros Garoufalidis.
