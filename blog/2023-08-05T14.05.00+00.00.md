### Abstract

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and
let $R[X]$ be the polynomial ring over $R$. Consider the following two subsets of $R[X]$:

$$
N := \{f \in R[X] ,|, c(f) = R\}\ \text{and}
$$
$$
U := \{f \in R[X] ,|, f {\rm \ is \ a \ monic \ polynomial} \}
$$.


Then $N$ and $U$ are multiplicative subset of $R[X]$, so we obtain the rings $R[X]_N$ and $R[X]_U$, which are called the *Nagata ring* of $R$ and *Serre's conjecture ring* of $R$ respectively. The Nagata rings and the Serre's conjecture rings has been researched actively.


In this talk, we investigate the new subring $R[X]_A$ of Nagata ring and Serre's conjecture ring and examine following problems:

1) If $R[X]_A$ is a PIR, then is $R$ a PIR? What about the converse?
2) If $R[X]_A$ is an arithmetical ring, then is $R$ an arithmetical ring? What about the converse?
3) If $R[X]_A$ is a Pr\"ufer ring, then is $R$ a Pr\"ufer ring? What about the converse?
