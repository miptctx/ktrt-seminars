### Abstract

In this paper, we develop a new method to produce explicit formulas for the number fG(n) of rooted spanning forests in the circulant graphs $G = Cn(s1, s2, . . . , sk)$ and $G = C2n(s1, s2, . . . , sk, n)$. These formulas are expressed through Chebyshev polynomials. We prove that in both cases the number of rooted spanning forests can be represented in the form $fG(n) = p a(n)2$, where $a(n)$ is an integer sequence and p is a certain natural number
depending on the parity of n. Finally, we find an asymptotic formula for fG(n) through the Mahler measure of the associated Laurent polynomial $P(z) = 2k+1−Pki=1(zsi+z−si)$.
