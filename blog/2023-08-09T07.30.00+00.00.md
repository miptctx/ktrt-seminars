### Abstract

We can associate surgeries on thickened surfaces to integer framings. Framed links in thickened surfaces have virtual framed link representations. Compact oriented 3-manifolds with boundary whose boundary is a disjoint union of two homeomorphic surfaces always have virtual framed link representations. By using these facts, we can define quantum invariants of such manifolds. This talk is based on the speaker's paper with Louis H. Kauffman. See
