### Abstract

The total face color polynomial is based upon the Poincar√© polynomials of a family of filtered n-color homologies. It is an abstract graph invariant when the graph is trivalent and calculates the sum of n-face colorings of ribbon graphs of the graph for each positive integer n. As such, it may be seen as a successor of the Penrose polynomial, which at n = 3 counts 3-edge colorings (and consequently 4-face colorings) of planar trivalent graphs. In this talk we describe a simple-to-express state sum formula for calculating the polynomial based upon earlier work of Lou Kauffman. This formula unites two different perspectives about graph coloring: one based upon topological quantum field theory and the other on diagrammatic tensors.
This is joint work with Lou Kauffman and Ben McCarty and is based upon the paper recently uploaded to the arXiv found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02732
