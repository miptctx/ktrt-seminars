### Abstract

This is joint work with Andy Bartholomew which started as an investigation into the possibilities of cataloguing doodles on the plane or sphere. As the work progressed more properties were discovered which led us to divide the doodles by connectivity. The second most connected are called ***prime*** and the most connected are called ***super prime.*** The word prime suggests that the doodle is not a ***sum*** and this is necessary by the ***Kishino effect*** which also occurs for virtual knots. The super prime doodles have a hamiltonian circuit by a theorem of Tutte. Whether this condition extends to other doodles is unknown to us, but it does mean that super prime doodles have a simple code using this cycle.
