### Abstract

We will show how to categorify the vertex bracket polynomial, which is based upon one of Roger Penrose's formulas for counting the number of 3-edge colorings of a planar trivalent graph. We produce a bigraded theory called bigraded n-color vertex homology whose graded Euler characteristic is the vertex bracket polynomial. We then produce a spectral sequence whose Eâˆž page is a filtered theory called filtered n-color vertex homology, and show that it is generated by certain types of properly colored ribbon subgraphs. In particular for n = 2, we show that the n-color vertex homology is generated by colorings that correspond to perfect matchings. This is joint work with Scott Baldridge.
