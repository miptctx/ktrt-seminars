### Abstract

In 2018, Watanabe disproved the 4-dimensional Smale conjecture by showing that the diffeomorphism group of a 4-dimensional disk relative to its boundary is non-contractible. In Watanabe's proof he used a version of Kontsevich's characteristic classes to detect non-trivial smooth families of disk bundles. In this talk we will show that Kontsevich's characteristic classes only depend the formal smooth structure, i.e. a lift of the tangent microbundle to a vector bundle. As an application, we will prove that for an arbitrary compact 4-manifold (with or without boundary), the forgetful map from diffeomorphism group to the homeomorphism group is not a rational homotopy equivalence. And we will prove the same result for the 4-dimensional Euclidian space. This is joint work with â€‹Yi Xie (Peking University)
