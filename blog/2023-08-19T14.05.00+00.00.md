### Abstract

We provide explicit and unified formulas for the cocycles of all degrees on the normalized bar resolutions of finite abelian groups. This is achieved by constructing a chain map from the normalized bar resolution to a Koszul-like resolution for any given finite abelian group. With the help of the obtained cocycle formulas, we compute the Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants of the n-torus for all n. This talk is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03266.pdf
