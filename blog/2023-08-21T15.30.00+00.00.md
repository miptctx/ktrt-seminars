## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

The non-bipartite knot conjecture, formulated in 1987 by JÃ³zef Przytitzky, remained open for 24 years, despite the efforts of several eminent mathematicians, including its author and J. H. Conway [3]. In 2011, S. Duzhin found a necessary condition for a knot to be bipartite and gave examples of non-bipartite knots. Further study of bipartite knots we explore their rich combinatorial structure and hidden connections with the four color graph theorem.
