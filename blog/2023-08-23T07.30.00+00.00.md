### Abstract

In this paper, we define a refined Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds. We show that the condition h 1,0 = h˜0,1 implies a symplectic structure on a compact almost complex 4 manifold, where ˜h 0,1 is the Hodge number of the refined Dolbeault cohomology and h 1,0 is the Hodge number of the Dolbeault cohomology defined by Cirici and Wilson [5]. Moreover, we prove that the condition h 1,0 = h˜0,1 is equivalent to ∂∂¯-lemma, which is similar to the case of compact complex surfaces. Meanwhile, unlike compact complex surfaces, we show that on compact almost complex 4 manifolds the equality b1 = h 0,1 +h 1,0 does not hold in general.
