## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

The groups $G^k_n$ were defined by V. O. Manturov in order to describe dynamical systems in configuration systems. In the talk we will consider two applications of this theory: we define a biquandle structure on the groups $G^k_n$, and construct a homomorphism from the surface singular braid monoid to the group $G^2_n$.
