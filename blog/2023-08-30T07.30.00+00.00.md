### Abstract

We present an approach to do Morse theory on symmetric products of surfaces, and show its relation to higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology (HDHF). As an application, we recover the finite Hecke algebra by Morse theory. We also sketch the application to spectral networks. This is joint work with Ko Honda and Yin Tian.
