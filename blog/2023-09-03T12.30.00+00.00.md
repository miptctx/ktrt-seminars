### Abstract

: The report is devoted to investigation of some spectral invariants of a family of circulant graphs. The invariants are: number of spanning trees (or complexity of a graph), number of rooted spanning forests and Kirchhoff index. They all can be expressed through eigenvalues of Laplacian (or Kirchhoff) matrix for a given graph.
