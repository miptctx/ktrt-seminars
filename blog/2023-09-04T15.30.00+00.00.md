### Abstract

In 2014, in the article “Quadratic differentials as stability conditions” T. Bridgeland and I. Smith proved that that moduli spaces of meromorphic *quadratic differentials* with simple zeroes on compact Riemann surfaces can be identified with spaces of *stability conditions* on a class of CY3 triangulated categories. These categories can be defined using quivers with potential associated to triangulated surfaces.
Any quadratic differential defines an anharmonic oscillator equation and one can ask whether it has as a solution *quasi-polynomial* (=polynomial multiplied by exponent). The general answer -- work in progress! -- should have a nice view in terms of the spaces of stability conditions .

In my talk I am going to present in examples Bridgeland-Smith's construction. If time permits I will speak about *Shapiro-Tater conjecture* which proof involves

quasi-polynomial solutions of a quartic anharmonic oscillators.
