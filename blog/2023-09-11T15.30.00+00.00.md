## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

In the present talk we discuss the techniques suggested in [V. O. Manturov, I.M. Nikonov, The groups Ð“n4, braids, and 3-manifolds, arXiv: 2305.06316] and the photography principle [V.O.Manturov, Z.Wan, The photography method: solving pentagon, hexagon, and other equations, arXiv:2305.11945] to open a very broad path for constructing invariants for manifolds of dimensions greater than or equal to 4.
