### Abstract

We will introduce two practical problems in the social choice theory.
The first scenario is envy-free division. Here, n friends are renting an n-bedroom apartment together. They need to split the rent and distribute the bedrooms among themselves so that everyone is happy with their bedroom, i.e., no one would prefer someone else's room to their own (given the rent). We will derive the existence of an envy-free division from Sperner's Lemma (combinatorial analog of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem).

The second scenario is peer evaluation. Here, n students work on a common task, and the job of the course instructor is to grade individual contributions to group work. We assume that there exists an objective truth - a vector of individual contributions that is known to students but not to the instructor. Students are required to do peer evaluation, i.e., all team members report their version of the truth. We will show then how the instructor can design a method of grading that encourages students to report the truth (the collective truth-telling is a strict Nash equilibrium).
