### Abstract

Skein modules were introduced by Józef H. Przytycki and by Vladimir Turaev independently. The Kauffman bracket skein module (KBSM) is the most extensively studied one. However, computing the KBSM of a 3-manifold is known to be notoriously hard, especially over the ring of Laurent polynomials. Marché conjectured that the KBSM of closed oriented $3$-manifolds splits into the direct sum of free and certain torsion modules over the ring of Laurent polynomials. The counterexample to this conjecture is given by the connected sum of two copies of the real projective space. With the goal of finding a definite structure of the KBSM over this ring, we compute KBSM of $S^1 \times S^2 \ \# \ S^1 \times S^2$. We show that it is isomorphic to KBSM of a genus two handlebody modulo some specific handle sliding relations. Moreover, these handle sliding relations can be written in terms of Chebyshev polynomials.  *This is joint work with Rhea Palak Bakshi and Xiao Wang*
