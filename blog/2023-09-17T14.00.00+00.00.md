### Abstract

: On the most intuitive level, defects are subsets of a space-time or a material where something special is going on. They are defective in the sense that the theory that governs them is different than the theory that governs the rest of the space. A topological defect is a defect that does not depend on metric. The theme of our work is the interpretation of an embedded graph as a defect, which facilitates the TQFT with defect to capture that number of ways a trivalent graph can be colored. In the process we construct a surface with defect for a given group and thus extending the work of Turaev (1999) in certain special cases.
