## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

Two smoothly embedded surfaces in a 4-manifold are called exotic if they are topologically isotopic but smoothly not. In 1997, Fintushel and Stern constructed the first examples of exotic surfaces. Since then, there have been many constructions of exotic surfaces in other settings, in particular, ones closer to the smooth unknotting conjecture.
In this talk, we give a construction of infinite families of exotic 2-spheres (in some 4-manifolds) that are topologically unknotted, and we show how to adapt the idea to obtain infinite families of exotic 2-links. This is a joint work with Bais, Malech and Torres (see also https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09659).
