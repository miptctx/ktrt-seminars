### Abstract

As a generalization of the classical knots, knotoids deal with the open ended knot diagram in a surface.
In recent years, many polynomial invariants for knotoids appeared, such as the bracket polynomial, the index polynomial and the $n$th polynomial, etc. 

In this talk, we introduce a new polynomial invariant $F$-polynomial for knotoids and discuss some properties of it. This is joint work with Yi Feng.
