### Abstract

The Khovanov (co)homology was introduced by Mikhail Khovanov in 2000 and Viro explained it in terms of enhanced states of diagram. Also J. González-Meneses, P.M.G. Manchón, M. Silvero proved (potential) extreme Khovanov homology of link is isomorphic to independence simplicial complex of Lando graph from the link. In this talk, we recall the definition of Khovanov homology. Furthermore we investigate the geometric realization of extreme Khovanov homology of some family of knots and links. This is joint work with Mark H Siggers and Seung Yeop Yang.
