### Abstract

The talk is devoted to describing matrix sets closed under conjugations and summing commuting elements. There are two well known important and principally different sets satisfying these properties: the sets of all semisimple and of all nilpotent matrices. It is also easy to see that the general case is directly reduced to describing such sets lying in some of these two special ones.
The talk is aimed to present the result obtained for an algebraically closed field.
