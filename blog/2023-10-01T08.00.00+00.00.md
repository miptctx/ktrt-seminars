### Abstract

A latin square of order n is an nxn table filled by n symbols so that each symbol appear in each line exactly once, and a transversal in a latin square is its diagonal hitting each symbol exactly ones. Natural multidimensional generalizations of latin squares are known as latin hypercubes. In this talk we overview most important results and open problems on transversals in latin squares and hypercubes.
