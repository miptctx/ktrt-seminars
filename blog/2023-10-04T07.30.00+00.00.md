### Abstract

Kervaire conjecture that the free product of every non-trivial groupand the infinite cyclic group is not normally generated by one elementis confirmed. The idea is to solve Conjecture Z of a knot exterior proposed by F. Gonzalez-Acuna and A. Ramirez as an equivalent conjecture. For this solution,a ribbon disk-link realization of a contractible finite complex and the asphericity ofa ribbon disk-link are used.
