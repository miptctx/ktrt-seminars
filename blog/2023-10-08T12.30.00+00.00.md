### Abstract

A word w being given it is easy to compute the set of its subwords and their multiplicity; this computation is obtained by a simple induction formula. The main problem of interest in this talk, sometimes implicitly but more often explicitly, is the one of the inverse correspondence. Under what conditions is a given set of words S the set of subwords, or a subset of certain kind of the set of subwords, of a word w? Once these conditions are met, what are the words w that are thus determined? In which cases are they uniquely determined? Some of these conditions on that set S are rather obvious. For instance if u is a subword ofw, then any subword of u is a subword of w. Some conditions are more subtle; if for instance a and b are two letters of A, and if ab and ba are subwords of w, then at least one of the two words aba and bab is also a subword of w. In fact, we shall consider the subwords with their multiplicity. It is possible to give a complete set of equations that express those relations.
