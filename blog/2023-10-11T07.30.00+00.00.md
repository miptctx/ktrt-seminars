### Abstract

Virtual knot theory is a proper generalisation of classical knot theory. It is known that virtual knots and links admit many powerful invariants and techniques that never appeared in classical knot theory.
In the talk we construct a map from braids, knots and links in the full torus to (closed relatives of) virtual braids, knots, and links.

The talk is based on joint papers of the speaker with I.M.Nikonov:

[**arXiv:2210.06862**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06862)

[**arXiv:2210.09689**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09689)

Many unsolved problems will be stated. Many research projects will be formulated.
