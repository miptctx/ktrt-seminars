### Abstract

In this talk we introduce a universal weight system (a function on chord diagrams satisfying the 4-term relation) taking values in the ring of polynomials in infinitely many variables, whose particular specialisations are weight systems associated with the Lie algebras gl(N) and Lie superalgebras gl(M|N). We extend this weight system to permutations and provide an efficient recursion for its computation.
