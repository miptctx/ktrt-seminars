## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

Some labellings of crossings compatible with Reidemeister moves like the
universal parity and the universal index admit topological interpretation (homological

parity and homotopical index). In the talk we present some other examples of topological

interpretation of universal labellings on knot diagrams in a fixed surface.
