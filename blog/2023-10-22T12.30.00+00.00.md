### Abstract

We formulate a general method allowing one to
1) solve various equations
2) construct invariants of topological objects

by using some very general notion of data and data transmission law. By data we mean, say, objects of geometric origin (lengths, areas, etc.), by data transmission law we mean some equations rewriting the data given in one system of coordinates in terms of some other system of coordinates (one key example is the Ptolemy equation). Such considerations allow one to solve various equations "for free". We shall concentrate on obtaining invariants of braids 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds, solutions to the pentagon equaitons and representations of groups $G_{n}^{3}$. This photography method ties together many branches in mathematics; in particular, our data transmission law is naturally related to see mutations in cluster algebras. Many known invariants (or their modifications) like Turaev-Viro(-like) invariants, Dijkgraaf-Witten-like invariants etc. turn out to be partial cases of the photography method (and its slight generalisation).

This is a joint work with L.H.Kauffman, I.M.Nikonov, S.Kim, and Z.Wan.
