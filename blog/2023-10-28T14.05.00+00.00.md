## Knots, graphs and groups

### Abstract

The notion of quandle was introduced independently by Joyce and Matveev as an invariant for knots. This invariant is very strong, however, usually it is difficult to determine if two knot quandles are isomorphic. Various tricks are used to solve this problem for individual cases of quandles. For each quandle, one can construct its orbit series tree. If two quandles are isomorphic, then their orbit series trees are also isomorphic. During the talk we are going to discuss relations between a quandle and its orbit series tree. In particular, we will discuss the question of when isomorphism of quandles follows from isomorphism of orbit series trees of these quandles. In addition, we are going to discuss various results about quandles which are described in terms of its orbit series tree.
