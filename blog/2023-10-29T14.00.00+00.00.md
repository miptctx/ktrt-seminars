### Abstract

Coating a knot with electrical charge could create a topological entity that would try to repel itself and find an energy-minimal position in space.
Computer modeling allows experiments with this idea, and we can try to see if such self-repelling fields will help unknot knots that are not knotted.

This talk will have demonstrations that such methods of unknotting sometimes work and sometimes do not work. We give systematic classes of examples by using 

rational knots and tangles that give such models great difficulties in unknotting. The talk will have a self-contained exposition of the Conway theory of rational tangles and their fractions. This is a very beautiful interface between the properties of tangles and the properties of continued fractions. We will even locate the “Eternal Golden Braid”

so long-sought since the time of Hofstadter. (I refer to the book by Douglas Hofstadter “Goedel, Escher, Bach - An Eternal Golden Braid”.)
