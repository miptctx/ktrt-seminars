### Abstract

M. Niebrzydowski and J. H. Przytycki defined a Kauffman bracket magma and constructed the invariant P of framed links in 3-space. The invariant is closely related to the Kauffman bracket polynomial. The normalized bracket polynomial is obtained from the Kauffman bracket polynomial by the multiplication of indeterminate and it is an ambient isotopy invariant for links. In this talk, we reformulate the multiplication by using a map from the set of framed links to a Kauffman bracket magma in order that P is invariant for links in 3-space. We define a generalization of a Kauffman bracket magma, which is called a marked Kauffman bracket magma. We find the conditions to be invariant under Yoshikawa moves except the first one and use a map from the set of admissible marked graph diagrams to a marked Kauffman bracket magma to obtain the invariant for surface-links in 4-space.
