### Abstract

Given a binary quasigroup G of order n, let the d-iterated quasigroup G[d] be the (d+1)-dimensional latin hypercube equal to the Cayley table of d times composition of G with itself. A diagonal of a latin hypercube is said to be a transversal if it contains all different symbols. We prove that for a given binary quasigroup G the d-iterated quasigroup G[d] has a transversal either only if d is even or for all large enough d. Moreover, there is r = r(G) such that if the number of transversals in G[d] is nonzero then, it is equal to $(1 + o(1)) n!^{d+1} / (r n^{n-1})$ as d tends to infinity. If G is a group, then r is the order of its commutator subgroup.
