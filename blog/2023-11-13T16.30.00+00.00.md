### Abstract

Given a connected graph with four vertices and six edges (a quadrilateral and its diagonals). We obtained a novel formula to find the length of any of its edges using the other five edge lengths. For example, in the case of a convex quadrilateral we are able to find the length of its diagonal using its side lengths and the length of the other diagonal. In the case of a concave quadrilateral (point inside a triangle), we are able to find the distance between this point and any of the vertices of the triangle.
