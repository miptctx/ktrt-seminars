### Abstract

The talk will discuss the Yangians of Lie superalgebras, an important example of quantum groups. Yangians of simple Lie algebras, as well as quantum groups, were introduced by V.G. Drinfeld in the eighties of the last century, but began to be studied somewhat earlier in the works of mathematical physicists, within the framework of the Bethe algebraic ansatz which is a method for studying quantum integrable models. Yangians are closely related to rational solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and appear as deformations of the Lie bialgebra of polynomial currents with values in the reductive Lie algebra. Since the mid-nineties of the last century, Yangians of Lie superalgebras (or superYangians) have also been studied. Currently, numerous connections have been discovered between Yangians and many problems in representation theory, mathematical and theoretical physics, including superstring theory, and this is an intensively developing area of research. I will try to talk about some, including new results, relating both to the Yangians of basic Lie superalgebras and to the Yangians of affine Kac-Moody superalgebras (affine superYangians), which began to be studied quite recently.
