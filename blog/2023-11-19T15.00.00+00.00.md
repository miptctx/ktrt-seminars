### Abstract

A knotoid is an equivalence class of knotoid diagrams under Reidemeister moves. A knotoid diagram is a tangle diagram with two ends. The ends do not have to be in the same region. Reidemeister moves are not allowed to pass arcs across endpoints. Knotoids were defined by Vladimir Turaev.
This talk will explain how the theory of knotoids (and more general linkoids and multiknotoids) works, how we use virtual knot theory to study knotoids, how knotoids can be interpreted geometrically in terms of embedded graphs and some of their applications. The work we discuss is joint work with Neslihan Gugumcu, Sofia Lambropoulou, Eleni Panagiotou and Kasturi Barkataki.
