### Abstract

The relation between Alexander polynomial of a knot and the torsion invariant of Reidemeister, Franz and de Rham for knot complement was first noticed by Milnor. As a consequence of the relation, Milnor gave another proof for symmetry of Alexander polynomial. Milnor applied the result to knot theory, considering the case of classical knot, i.e. the knot complement has the homology of the circle. It turns out that there are similar relations between Reidemeister torsion and twisted Alexander polynomial for the case of knot complement in other spaces, rather than three dimensional sphere when the homology group contains also torsion. The technology to get explicit relations as Milnor had created making use of simple homotopy theory for CW-complexes and Fox free differential calculus. Those ensure a CW structure for the knot complement, associated with a presentation of the fundamental group, so that the boundary maps are obtained by free derivatives. The method works out fine also for the case of knots and links in three dimensional torus. Thus we show that the Reidemeister torsion of the link complement and its twisted Alexander polynomial are equal.
