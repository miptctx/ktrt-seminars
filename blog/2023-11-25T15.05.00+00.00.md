## Knots, graphs and groups

### Abstract

In theory of knots and braids, there is a special type of groups closely connected with braid groups â€” namely, groups $\Gamma_n^4$. Each of them is given by involutive generators indexed by ordered $4$-tuples of pairwise distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ and some special relations between them.
The speaker's research is concentrated mainly on algebraic structure of groups $\Gamma_n^4$. His main result is that, for any $n\geqslant7$, the groups $\Gamma_n^4$ and $\Gamma_n^4/(\Gamma_n^4)'$ are isomorphic to direct products of finitely many copies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, in part, that $\Gamma_n^4$ is a nilpotent finite $2$-group with $4$-torsion.

If time allows, all are the most of the proof will be presented.
