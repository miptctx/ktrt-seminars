## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

Zeeman's theorem tells us that both the 5-twist spun trefoil and the 2-twist spun torus knot T(3,5) are fibered knotted spheres in 4-dimensional space where the fiber is the punctured Poincare homology sphere. That closed homology sphere is the quotient of the 3-sphere under the action of the binary icosahedral group. It is a 5-fold or 2-fold branched cover of 3-space branched over the respective knot. The group is isomorphic to SL_2(Z/5). I want to understand all of the statements asserted above. To that end, I am working on comparing three different presentations of this group. In as much as possible, I will explicitly represent the elements in the group as strings with quipu, matrices, generators, and elements in the 3-sphere. I'll also give different pictures that allow one to compute relationships among the words in the standard presentation of the group. I'm also interested in braiding the homology sphere in 5-space.
