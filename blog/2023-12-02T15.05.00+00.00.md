### Abstract

It is well-known that a classical link diagram is checkerboard colorable. The notion of a checkerboard coloring for a virtual link diagram was independently introduced by V.O.Manturov (in 2000) and N. Kamada (in 2002) by using atom and corresponding abstract link diagram, respectively. M.O. Bourgoin introduced the twisted knot theory in 2008 and defined the notion of a checkerboard coloring for a twisted link diagram.
In this talk, we first give two new criteria to detect the checkerboard colorability of virtual links by using odd writhe and arrow polynomial of virtual links, respectively. Then by applying these criteria we determine the checkerboard colorability of virtual knots up to four crossings, with only one exception.

Second, we reformulate the arrow polynomial of twisted links by using Kauffman's formalism. In fact, in 2012, in case of using the pole diagram, N. Kamada obtained the polynomial by generalizing a multivariable polynomial invariant of a virtual link to a twisted link. Moreover, we figure out three characteristics of the arrow polynomial of a checkerboard colorable twisted link, which is a tool of detecting checkerboard colorability of a twisted link. The latter two characteristics are the same as in the case of checkerboard colorable virtual link diagram.
