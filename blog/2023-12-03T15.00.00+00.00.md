### Abstract

This will be an elementary introduction to quantum link invariants, based on generalized Reidemeister moves for link diagrams in Morse form.
We emphasize how to convert such a diagram to an abstract tensor diagram in the sense of Penrose so that the contraction of this tensor is an invariant of regular isotopy.

We will discuss how this approach to quantum link invariants is related to categorical formulations and to the finding of solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, and if time permits with the structure of Hopf algebras.
