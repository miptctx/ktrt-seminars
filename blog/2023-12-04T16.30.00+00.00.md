### Abstract

K-stability is a recent theory that interacts with complex and analytic geometry, birational geometry and moduli theory. Take a Fano variety (a complex projective variety with positive Ricci curvature). Can we construct a compact moduli space that parametrises all the ‘reasonable' degenerations of this variety (including fairly singular ones) and that it is itself ‘reasonable' as a space? The answer is positive if the variety is K-(poly)stable and this moduli space, known as K-moduli, parametrises all K-polystable Fano varieties. From a complex viewpoint, K-polystable Fano varieties are precisely those which admit a Kahler-Einstein metric.
Smooth Fano varieties have been classified up to dimension 3 but until recent work by Abban-Zhuang and others, we did not have enough tools to decide which ones were K-polystable, let alone to describe the K-moduli itself. In this talk I will survey these notions and present recent progress in the subject, with special emphasis in the programme to classify Fano varieties and their K-moduli in low dimensions.
