### Abstract

For a 3-manifold $M$, let $S(M)$ denote its Kauffman bracket skein module. Problem 1.92 (G) (i) in the Kirby's list asks whether $S(M)$ is free when $M$ is irreducible and has no incompressible non-parallel to the boundary torus. We answer this negatively by showing that $S(M)$ contains torsion when $M$ is the complement of a 4-strand Montesinos knot in the 3-sphere.
