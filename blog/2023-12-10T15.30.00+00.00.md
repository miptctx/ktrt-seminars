### Abstract

We provide a novel form of Heron's formula and a novel form of Bretschneider's formula. We provide several applications illustrating what is the advantage of these novel forms over the standard forms. Moreover, written in this form we see an obvious link between the area formulas of different shapes and this allows us to state a conjecture for expressing the area of any pentagon (or any other polygon) using its side lengths and the lengths of some of its diagonals.
