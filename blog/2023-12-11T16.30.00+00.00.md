### Abstract

We will consider several problems related to Rota-Baxter operators and Hopf algebras:
1) construction of group Rota-Baxter operators of arbitrary weight on Lie groups
2) conditions under which a Rota-Baxter operator on a group is a Rota-Baxter operator of a group algebras
3) construction of relative Roth-Baxter operators for noncommutative Hopf algebras
