### Abstract

Professor Manturov will talk in more detail about two constructions suggested in the papers https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06862, https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09689 where classical objects (classical braid, knots in the full torus and knots in the thickened torus) are mapped analogues of virtual knots: the so-called flat-virtual knots. Professor Manturov will discuss various invariants of the latter leading to lots of invariants of classical objects, generalising the Burau representation, Kauffman bracket, and many other objects. Many unsolved problems will be formulated during the talk.
