### Abstract

In this presentation, I will review progress in Dr. Sedrakyan's and my work to generalize the pentagon case of the photography principle. I will also give a novel application, go in depth on the derivation of *Theorem 2 (Sedrakyan-Mozayeni)*, and explain current issues with the pentagon case of the photography principle. Furthermore, this presentation will explain another application, and close off by explaining a potential creation of a pentagon theorem that could aid in generalizing the case.
