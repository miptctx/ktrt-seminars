### Abstract

I'm going to talk about the basic constructions of the theory of quantum algebras (quantum groups). The quantum group is a Hopf algebra, appearing as a quantization or flat deformation of a Lie bialgebra. I will also talk about a graded version of this theory, the theory of quantum supergroups, as well as an important class of quantum groups, namely, triangular (quasitriangular, braided) quantum groups, associated with the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.
We will also talk about the classical version of the theory of quantum algebras, namely the theory of Lie bialgebras. If there is time, I might talk about the representation theory of these objects, as well as the categorical version of this theory. I will try to explain all the necessary concepts during the report, but it is advisable to know what a Lie group and Lie algebra are.
