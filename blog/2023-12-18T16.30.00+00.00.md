### Abstract

An equivalent condition for an element of a Lie algebra acting nilpotently in all its representations is obtained. Namely, it should belong to the derived algebra and go via factoring over the radical to a nilpotent element of the corresponding (semisimple) quotient algebra.The talk is based on the speaker's preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13309
