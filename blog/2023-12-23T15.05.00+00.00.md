### Abstract

In the work arXiv:2312.07939 we describe the category WC2 of weighted 2-complexes and its subcategory WC1 of weighted graphs. Since a Coxeter group is defined by its Coxeter graph, the construction of Coxeter groups defines a functor from WC1 to the category of groups. We generalize the notion of a Coxeter group by extending the domain of the functor to the category WC2. It appears that the resulting functor generalizes the construction of Coxeter groups, Gauss pure braid groups $GVP_{n}$ (introduced by V. Bardakov, P. Bellingeri, and C. Damiani in 2015), k-free braid groups on n strands $G_{n}^{k}$ (introduced by V. Manturov in 2015), and other quotients of Coxeter groups.
