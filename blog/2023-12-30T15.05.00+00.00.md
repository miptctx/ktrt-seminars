### Abstract

In my last presentation of this seminar on the 19th of December in 2023, a new mapping (projection) is given from any point in its original dimensional space to other dimensional space. In the series of mappings, any point has invariant or symmetry. In other words, the degree of freedom (the number of variables) of any point is unchangeable in the series of mappings. In this time, we explain mathematical definitions in terms of quotient vector space. The first aim is to define our new notions in the last presentation more mathematically. The second aim is to introduce a more concrete mappings from a higher dimensional space to a lower dimensional one.
