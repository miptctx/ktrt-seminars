## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

We will prove that for a given virtual link L and a virtual biquandle (X,f,R), the set of colorings of L by (X,f,R) is in bijection with the set of colorings of L by a biquandle (X,VR), where VR is a new operator we define on X. The biquandle (X,VR) is the 1-induced biquandle associated with (X,f,R). Moreover, we will prove that for a virtual link L, the associated biquandle BQ(L) is isomorphic to the 1-induced biquandle of the virtual biquandle VBQ(L). Furthermore, the 1-induced biquandle of VBQ(L) is isomorphic to VBQ(L) as virtual biquandles. If time permits, we will introduce a cohomology theory for (X,f,R) and give its applications to knots.
