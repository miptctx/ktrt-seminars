## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

We will discuss some properties of knots in three dimensional projective space. Our technique for this purpose is to associate a virtual link to a link in projective space so that equivalent projective links go to equivalent virtual links (modulo a special flype move). We can then apply techniques in virtual knot theory to obtain a Jones polynomial for projective links which also happens to be equivalent to the Jones polynomial constructed by Drobotukhina. Then we would discuss a combinatorial cobordism theory for projective links which may be used to apply virtual Khovanov homology and the virtual Rasmussen invariant of Dye, Kaestner, and Kauffman to projective links.
