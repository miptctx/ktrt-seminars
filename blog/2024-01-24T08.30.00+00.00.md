### Abstract

The notion of an enriched (fusion) category naturally appears in the study of the mathematical theory of topological orders. In this talk, I will introduce a symmetric monoidal 2-category of enriched categories with arbitrary background categories. Then the notion of an enriched (braided or symmetric) monoidal category can be defined as an E_n-algebra in this 2-category. Finally I will introduce the notion of a center and compute the center of an enriched (monoidal or braided monoidal) category. This talk is based on a joint work arXiv:2104.03121 with Liang Kong, Wei Yuan and Hao Zheng.
