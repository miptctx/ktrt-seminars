### Abstract

Let p be a polynomial in several non-commuting variables with coefficients in an algebraically closed field K of arbitrary characteristic. It has been conjectured that for any n, for p multilinear, the image of p evaluated on the set $M_n(K)$ of n by n matrices is either zero, or the set of scalar matrices, or the set sl_n(K) of matrices of trace 0, or all of $M_n(K)$.
In this talk we will discuss the generalization of this result for non-associative algebras such as Cayley-Dickson algebra (i.e. algebra of octonions), pure (scalar free) octonion Malcev algebra and basic low rank Jordan algebras.
