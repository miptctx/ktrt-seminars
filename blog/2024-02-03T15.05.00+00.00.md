### Abstract

In 2022, the author and I.M.Nikonov have noticed that knots in the full cylinder
$S^{1}\times D^{2}$ have some "hidden" crossings. As a result, this lead to the development

of "flat-virtual theory" and a map from knots/links in the thickened cylinder to knots flat virtual knots/links.

In the present talk, we discuss possible ways of generalising this approach to the 3-dimensional thickening of the Moebius band and to the $RP^{3}$ thought of as a 3-dimensionaAbstract:l thickening of RP^{3}.
