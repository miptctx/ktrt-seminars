### Abstract

This will be an informal talk about how one can generalize state sum invariants for classical knots that model the Alexander Conway polynomial and the Jones polynomial to two variable state sum invariants for knotoids and linkoids that are chirality sensitive. This will be a self-contained talk with many examples.
