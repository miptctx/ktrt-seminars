### Abstract

We introduce a local deformation called a virtualized Delta move for unoriented virtual knots and links. We prove that it is an unknotting operation for unoriented virtual knots, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for two unoriented virtual links of two or more components to be related by a finite sequence of virtualized Delta moves. We also talk about virtualized Delta, sharp, and pass moves for oriented virtual knots and links. This is a joint work with Takuji Nakamura, Yasutaka Nakanishi, and Shin Satoh.
