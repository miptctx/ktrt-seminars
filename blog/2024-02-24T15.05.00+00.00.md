### Abstract

Jones polynomial is a famous knot invariant discovered by V.Jones in 1984.The Jones unknot problem is a question whether there is a non-trivial knotwith the trivial Jones polynomial. The answer to this fundamental questionis still unknown despite numerous attempts to solve it. In the talk I willgive a brief review on different approaches to this question. I willdescribe in more detail the construction of Jones polynomials (and HOMFLY-PT) through the braid group and its representations using quantum R-matrices. We will discuss in detail a family of knots that are the closureof 4-braids. I will talk about what options there are for solving the Jonesproblem in this case, both positively and negatively. The talk is based ona recent preprint arXiv:2402.02553 (joint work of Dmitriy Korzun, ElenaLanina, Alexey Sleptsov).
