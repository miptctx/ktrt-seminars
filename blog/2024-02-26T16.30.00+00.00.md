## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

Quantum theory suggests that the three observed gauge groups U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) are related to the three Reidemeister moves of knot theory: twists, pokes and slides. The background for the relation is clarified: modelling particles as fluctuating tangles of strands explains wave functions. Classifying tangles explains the elementary fermions and bosons. It is then shown that twists generate U(1) and that pokes generate SU(2). The emphasis is put on deducing the relation between slides, the corresponding strand deformations, the Gell-Mann matrices, and the Lie group SU(3). Consequences for unification are deduced.
