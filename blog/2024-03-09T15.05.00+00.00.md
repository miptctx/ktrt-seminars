### Abstract

For each punctured surface admitting a triangulation, we may associate two algebras. One is the cluster algebra of surfaces, and the other is the generalized skein algebra from quantum topology. In this talk, I will explain their compatibility and some consequences in the Teichmuller theory and the structure of cluster algebra.
