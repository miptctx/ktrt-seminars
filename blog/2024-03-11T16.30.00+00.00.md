## Knots and representation theory

### Abstract

In attempts to construct a map from classical knots to virtual ones, we define a series of maps from knots in the full torus (thickened torus) to flat-virtual knots. We give definition of flat-virtual knots and presents Alexander-like polynomial and Kauffman bracket for them. We also discuss a possible extension of the notion of flat-virtual knots â€” so-called multi-flat knots.
