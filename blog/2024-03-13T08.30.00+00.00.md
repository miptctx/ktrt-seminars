### Abstract

The purpose of this talk is to define a family of (concordance and link-homotopy) invariants of knotted surfaces in 4-space. The construction is modeled on Milnor link invariants, which are numerical concordance invariants of links in 3-space, extracted from the nilpotent quotients of the link group. Our construction makes use of "cut-diagrams" of knotted surfaces in 4-space, which encode these objects in a simple combinatorial way. Roughly speaking, for a knotted surface obtained as embedding of the abstract surface S, a cut-diagram is a kind of 1-dimensional diagram on S with some labeling. We will provide several examples and applications. No expertise in 4-dimensional topology is required for this talk. This is a joint work with Benjamin Audoux and Akira Yasuhara.
