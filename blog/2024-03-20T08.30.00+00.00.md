## Moscow-Beijing topology seminar

### Abstract

A natural problem in topology is to determine which manifolds admit certain group actions. The problem we concern in this talk is to determine which highly connected (2n+1)-manifolds admit free circle actions. I will introduce some previous work and our progress on this problem. This is a joint work with Yang Su.
