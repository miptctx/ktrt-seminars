### Abstract

The Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface is a generalization of the Jones polynomial for links and is one of few constructions from quantum topology that is clearly related to hyperbolic geometry. To further understand the relationship, it is important to understand the multiplicative structure of the skein algebra. In this talk, we present a recursion relation and fast algorithm for multiplication in the skein algebra in the case of a 1-hole torus.
