### Abstract

We will discuss the gamma vector, which was originally considered in the context of the combinatorics of Eulerian polynomials and later resurfaced in a special case of the Hopf conjecture on Euler characteristics of (piecewise Euclidean) nonpositively curved manifolds in work of Gal. Since then, it has appeared in many different combinatorial applications. We find explicit formulas which give a local-global interpretation and complement/contrast lower bound properties stated earlier by Gal. In addition, a formula involving Catalan numbers and binomial coefficients hints at connections to noncrossing partitions and Coxeter groups in existing positivity examples. Finally, we note considering characteristic classes directly lead to log concavity and Schur positivity properties.
