### Abstract

For a connected surface Σ with connected boundary, there exist two very different constructions of the same family of representations of the mapping class group Mod(Σ): one comes from the non-semisimple TQFT associated with the quantum group of sl(2), while the other arises from twisted homology groups of configuration spaces of Σ. I will explain the equivalence between the two actions, and how this is expected to generalize in the presence of cohomology classes. This is based on joint works with Jules Martel and Bangxin Wang.
