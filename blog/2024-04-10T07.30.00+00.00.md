### Abstract

I will explain how to build a new embedding of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface into a localized quantum torus via Dehn-Thurston coordinates. The quantum torus is said to be localized because certain extra elements need to be inverted. An important property is that the localized quantum torus is somehow a finite extension of the skein algebra. As an application I will show how to recover a proof of the unicity conjecture already proved by Frohman, Kania-Bartoszynska and LÃª. An explicit description of most irreducible representations of the skein algebra at root of unity will be possible.
This is joint work with Renaud Detcherry.
