### Abstract

In this seminar I will talk about the non-Reidemeister knots theory suggested by Manturov V.O. We will consider the invariant of pure braids $\Gamma_n^4$, that is constructed by considering the braid as a dynamical system and which gives representations for braids in the form of words and in the form of 2x2 matrices. Finally, I will propose another pure braid invariant in matrices of (2n-4)x(2n-4) size, which is naturally obtained from the Delaunay triangulation of a sphere.
