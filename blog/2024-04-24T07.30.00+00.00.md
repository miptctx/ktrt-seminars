### Abstract

We show that any Lie algebroid A admits a Nash-type blow-up Nash(A) that sits in a nice short exact sequence of Lie algebroids 0-->K-->p\*A-->D-->0 with K a Lie algebra bundle and D a Lie algebroid whose anchor map is injective on an open dense subset. The base variety is a blowup determined by the singular foliation of A. We provide concrete examples. Moreover, we extend the construction following Mohsen's to singular subalgebroids in the sense of Androulidakis-Zambon.
