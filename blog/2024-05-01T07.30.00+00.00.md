### Abstract

The talk will be devoted to an introduction to the word theory and the description of several problems that it is concerned with. We will call a "word" an infinite sequence of symbols that is generated from a dynamical system.$M$ --- a compact metric space$U$ --- open subspace of M$f : M \rightarrow M$ is a homeomorphism of the compact into itself$x_0 \in M$ — an initial point. It determines a sequence of symbols
$$
w_n = \begin{cases} a, f^{(n)}(x_0)\in U \\ b, f^{(n)}(x_0)\not \in U \end{cases}
$$

We will be investigating the different combinations of m consecutive symbols (”subwords”) that can be found in such words depending on which dynamic system was used to generate them. We will be looking at the famous Sturmian sequences, some of their generalizations and their Rauzy graphs in more detail. Several dynamic systems and their implications will be discussed in more detail. Namely, circle rotation, interval exchange transformation, billiards, the first digit of $2^n$, $n!$, $2^{n^2}$ , the second digit of $2^n$.
