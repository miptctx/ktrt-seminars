## Knots, graphs and groups

### Abstract

This talk is an introduction to Multiple Virtual Knot Theory (MVKT) where one has classical crossings, flat crossings, singular crossings and a multiplicity of virtual crossings.
All virtual crossings can make detour moves over all the other crossing types including the other virtuals. We will discuss a number of different invariants in this theory and also its relationship with coloring problems and Penrose evaluations and Penrose perfect matching polynomials (as related to joint work with Scott Baldrige and Ben McCarty). We will discuss relationships of MVKT with virtual knot theories on surfaces of genus greater than zero, with welded MVTK and braid groups for these theories.
