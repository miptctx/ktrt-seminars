### Abstract

We investigate the magnitude for Nakayama algebras. Using Ringel's resolution quiver, the existence and the value of rational magnitude is given. As a result, we show directly that two finite global dimension criteria for Nakayama algebras are equivalent. This is a joint work with Yaru Wu.
