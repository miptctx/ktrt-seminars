### Abstract

We prove that the family of largest cuts in the binomial random graph exhibits the following stability property: with high probability, there is a set of (1-o(1))n vertices that is partitioned in the same manner by all maximum cuts. We also show some applications of this property - in particular, to the validity of Simonovits's property in binomial random graphs.
The talk is based on joint work with Ilay Hoshen and Wojciech Samotij
