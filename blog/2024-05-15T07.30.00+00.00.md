### Abstract

In this talk, I will introduce welded graphs, that can be seen as combinatorial objects lying between 3-dimensional knots and 4-dimensional knotted surfaces. For these objects, I will define a notion of peripheral system from which I will extract Milnor invariants. This will lead to a complete classification of knotted punctured spheres (with trivially embedded boundary) up to link-homotopy.
